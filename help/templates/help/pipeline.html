      <p class="card-text">
        Get started with SEAT Reports, the easiest way for non-technical users to create sentiment analysis reports
        using our proprietary pipeline.<br>
        All the steps in a pipeline are introduced below. We recommend that you constantly refer to this page, while creating your first pipeline.

        This is the beginning of your pipeline. Simply enter a report name and a short description.<br><br>

        <b>Criteria(s):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>You cannot have reports with the same names.</li>

      <h5 class="card-title">Step One: Extract Tweets</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        In order to extract relevant tweets from Twitter, you are allowed to include up to 5 keywords in your final query.
        The usage of hashtags and mentions often provide more relevant results.
        You are encouraged to experiment with different queries to extract the most suitable tweets dataset.<br><br>

        <b>Criteria(s):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Each row in form must either be fully completed or left empty</li>
          <li>Each row may only contain one keyword</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note(s):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The dataset can take up to one minute to be extracted, depending on your query's complexity and number of tweets.</li>
          <li>The Twitter API only allows users to extract up to 7 days worth of tweets. Thus, you may not receive all your requested tweets.</li>

      <h5 class="card-title">Step Two: Filter Tweets</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        This step will help you separate relevant and irrelevant tweets in your dataset, allowing you to focus only on the relevant ones.
        Just like the previous step, you are welcome to test different keywords.
        <br><br>

        <b>Format(s):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Keyword Group Name: The name you give the the group of keywords. The Group name itself is not used in the filtering algorithm.</li>
          <li>Keywords: Words you wish to use in filtering algorithm to detect irrelevant tweets. Separate each word with a semicolon.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note(s):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Keywords are NOT case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>Keyword Group Names cannot be the same.</li>
          <li><i>Remember to input variations of the same words in your list of keywords</i> (e.g. POTUS; realDonaldTrmp; Trump)</li>

      <h5 class="card-title">Step Three: Categorise Tweets</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        This step will help you separate tweets into different categories, allowing you create a deeper analysis of user sentiments.
        <br><br>

        <b>Which method should I choose?</b>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have several words/phrases for each category (small text body), use absolute method.</li>
          <li>If you have several sentences or a paragraph for each category (large text body), use NLP method.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Absolute Method</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Not all tweets would be categorised, and may be categorised into 2 or more groups.</li>
          <li>Directly matches tweets to your categories, when at least one exact keyword is found as a <i>standalone</i> word or phrase.</li>
          <li>Example sentence matching keyword 'realDonaldTrump': "@realDonaldTrump is a donkey."</li>
          <li>Example sentence NOT matching keyword 'virus': "Dogs are nothing more than viruses."</li>
        </ul>

        <b>NLP Method</b>
        <ul>
          <li>All tweets will be categorised, according to your inputs, and to only one category.</li>
          <li>Since all tweets are categorised, your inputs should cover the vast majority of tweets for categorisation.</li>
          <li>
            Especially useful when categories are better described with large text bodies,
            because they are broad and have lots of matching keywords.
          </li>
          <li>If there is a huge number of tweets, NLP Method will have a perforamnce advantage over Absolute Method.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Formats:</b> (Examples can be found in Step 3 of Pipeline)
        <ul>
          <li>Absolute Method: (Similar to Step 2)</li>
          <li>NLP Method: Instead of words, input sentences or a paragraph. Semicolons are not necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Keywords are NOT case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>Category names cannot be the same. The name 'Non-Categorised' is reserved and cannot be used.</li>
        </ul>

      <h5 class="card-title">Step Four: Choosing Model(s)</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        In the final step of your pipeline, choose your preferred sentiment analysis model(s).
        If you are unfamiliar with their different properties, we recommend that you select all of them and choose the most suitable.
        <br><br>

        <b>Note(s):</b>
        <ul>
          <li>All models are pre-trained, and therefore do not require training data/manual labelling from user.</li>
          <li>Limitation: The models uses generic keywords to analyze sentiment (e.g. terrible, amazing), so they are incapable of processing topic-specific sentiment keywords.</li>
