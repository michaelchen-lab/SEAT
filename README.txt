How it works

This is a sentiment analysis tool meant to help users extract tweet data on their interested topic, and run sentiment analysis on that data.

Step 1: Extraction of tweets through Twitter API using keywords chosen by users

Step 2: Filter out irrelevant data and discard them using keywords chosen by users

Step 3: Categorise relevant data using topics chosen by users, and their corresponding keywords.

Step 4: Sentiment analysis is performed using pre-trained NLP model(s)

Result: A final report is generated containing sentiment analysis results.
